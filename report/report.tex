    \section*{Brief write-up on BLE distance estimator}
    
    \subsection*{1. Introduction}
    My project focuses basically on estimating distance between two BLE devices, using BLE's built-in measurement and declaration of transmit and received power strength. The following sections contain a brief introduction about how the final result is obtained and an rough analysis on the performance.
    
    \subsection*{2. Relation between distance \& received signal strength}
    \subsection*{3. Final result}
